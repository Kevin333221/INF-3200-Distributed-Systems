# How to run the code

1. Change into the bash scripts directory:
    ```bash
    cd bashScripts
    ```

2. Ensure run.sh and clean.sh have execute permissions. If not, run the following commands:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    chmod +x clean.sh
    ```
    
3. Run:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh {number_of_nodes} {identifier_space}
    ```
    Where:
    - number_of_nodes: The number of nodes to be created in the network.
    - identifier_space: The identifier space of the network. This is the maximum value of the identifier that can be generated by the nodes. The identifier space is a power of 2.

    Note: The nodes will automatically be shutdown after 10 minutes.
